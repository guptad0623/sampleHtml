var in which we store the data						NaN----> Not A Number
in javascript there is a dynamic data type for e.g. 
<script>
	a=20;
	a="sasa";
	document.write(a)  
</script>
It always pick the second value, because of overwrite the value
<script>
	a=20.58;
	document.write(typeof a)  
</script>
typeof is a keyword which shows a data type
